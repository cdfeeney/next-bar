## Items

### g-5cb22f54 — COMPLETE (NICE, 3 Santa rounds, quorum met every round)

**Commits** (all local, branch feat/beta1-account-sync; nothing pushed, nothing deployed,
no migration applied, no credentials read, no Staging/Production/TestFlight contact):
- 4c3eccd fix: tokenless Stop-Sharing (RED-proven; exact confirmation sentence)
- f40783a→bec2e3a feat: persistence v2.1 (readiness barrier, quarantine journal,
  read-back confirmation, retry ladder, gate UI, sign-out dialog, migration 0042 amended
  in place — UNAPPLIED by design)
- 48494b3 fix: santa round-1 (12 verified findings, 11 RED-proven tests)
- 114e5bb fix: santa round-2 (supersede-preserving commit, no mid-flight clobber,
  honest write notifications; 7 RED-proven tests + 2 guards)
- 66a9c02 fix: santa round-3 (digest-guarded envelope mutations, raw-invalid supersede
  single-key path, invalid-bytes capture before hydrate x3, rollover archive gate;
  7 RED-proven tests)

**Final verification**: tsc clean; vitest 2121/2121; gate+nights e2e 31/31 on iPhone 13 +
Pixel 7; next build clean; git diff --check clean; secret scan clean. Pre-existing e2e
failures at HEAD (map-lightbox x3, photo-card x1) proven pre-existing via git stash baseline.

**Panel (T0 full, unattended, fail-closed)** — every round quorum met:
- R1 (bec2e3a): FABLE + Codex + GLM + DeepSeek + Kimi — 12 verified findings fixed.
- R2 (48494b3): FABLE (2 Medium) + Codex proof 70befe25 (2 High: quarantine commit
  destroyed superseded divergent copy; release hydrated over newer mid-flight edit).
- R3 (114e5bb / final range for routed lanes): FABLE (2 Medium: invalid-bytes hydrate
  clobber, rollover archive race — fixed), Codex proof 444ea15a (2 High: stale-tab
  release/update unguarded, raw-invalid single-key overwrite — fixed), DeepSeek (no
  blockers), GLM (5 candidates all refuted with repo evidence), Kimi deep (no Critical,
  architecture holds).

**Lane-unique catches**: Codex R2 caught the supersede-destroys-preserved-copy bug that
FABLE R2 explicitly traced and called benign — model diversity earned its cost. FABLE R3
caught the invalid-bytes and rollover gaps no other lane saw.

**Codex timeouts**: R2 first attempt and R3-scoped first attempt hit 540s (bounded-run
terminated the process tree both times); both succeeded on retry with narrowed 3-question
task files and returned valid proofs.

**Residuals (documented, no code change — human decisions for morning)**:
1. Superseded chains uncapped — operator-locked no-eviction/no-cap; drain = one promoted
   conflict per release through the existing dialog. (Codex R3 Medium)
2. Rollover-refusal is silent (visit dropped, history preserved) — Kimi recommends a
   Retry banner; GLM concurred. Beta+1 candidate.
3. Equal-clock divergent live value loses the LWW tie to the server on next sync —
   pre-existing designed rule, only reachable via non-stamping writer anomaly. (DeepSeek)
4. Kimi Beta+1 recommendations: unify cold stores into one preservation log; aggregate
   "preserved copies awaiting review" badge.
5. Migration 0042 remains UNAPPLIED (out of scope per goal); 0043 reserved for Beta+1.

## Run result — QUEUE_REMAINING (1 blocked, 1 paused, 3 untouched)

**Item 3 — g-b9dc294e — BLOCKED after 3 full Santa rounds.**
Commits: 1153e1a, cea6214, 3532131, ff85f11 on fix/nighttime-mobile-hardening (from b6a7957).
Real fixes landed: modal heading min-w-0 + break-words + line-clamp-3 + title; BarPicker address
span shrink-0 -> min-w-0 truncate; named-list chips min-w-0 max-w-full break-words; a generic
"no nested scroller has a horizontal axis" guard; add-bar-overflow added to the iPhone 17 project.
Verified: 31 passed on iPhone 13 + Pixel 7 + iPhone 17; 157 files / 2339 unit tests; typecheck,
build, secret-scan, git diff --check clean.

UNRESOLVED BLOCKER (rounds exhausted): QuickAddBar variant="search" (lines 211-226) renders its
match list in a bare overflow-hidden ul with an unconstrained name span - silent, affordance-free
clipping, the same defect class, in the path every returning user with >=1 rating takes
(rankings/page.tsx:216). Claude/FABLE measured scrollWidth 1025 vs clientWidth 340. NO test in the
suite reaches it, because gotoRankings() clears localStorage and so always takes the dialog path.

**Item 4 — g-cb7cefd2 — PAUSED, no code written.**
Root-caused: viewportFit:'cover' IS set (layout.tsx:68); the codebase has NO safe-area-inset-top
anywhere - only inset-bottom. Sites: page.tsx:82 header (px-6 py-4), BarLightbox.tsx:306 column
(px-4 py-6). Open test-design problem recorded: Playwright does not emulate safe-area insets, so
env(safe-area-inset-top) is 0 in test and criterion 7's geometry assertion is trivially satisfiable.

**Items 5, 6, 7 — planned, untouched. Items 1, 2, 8 — untouched.**

### Model lanes (Item 3)
Round 1: Claude/FABLE + Codex + GLM + DeepSeek — 4/4 quorum.
Round 2: same four — 4/4 quorum.
Round 3: Claude/FABLE + Codex — GLM/DeepSeek not re-run on the round-3 delta.

Findings unique to each lane:
- Codex only: the nested-scroller blind spot's test consequences; the line-clamp affordance hole.
- Claude/FABLE only: the vacuous list-chip seed (missing createdAt/updatedAt); the search-variant gap.
- GLM + DeepSeek only: the arbitrary max-w-[45%] cap; async settling before measuring.
- All four: the overflow-y-auto => overflow-x:auto absorption.

### Process errors, recorded honestly
1. I backgrounded review agents while running my own builds/Playwright in the same worktree. Their
   mutate-and-restore testing uses `git checkout --`, which reset to HEAD and twice silently
   reverted my UNCOMMITTED fixes; their Playwright runs also spawned next dev on :3000 and
   contended with next build over .next, producing two misleading failures (/api/flags, then
   /_document) that were artifact contention, not code. Reviewers must be serialized.
2. A reviewer ran `git stash push -u` despite the operator's explicit ban on stashing. It remains as
   stash@{0} ("santa-round3-preserve-inflight-edit"). I did NOT drop it - dropping is deleting. It
   holds an earlier version of the line-clamp edit that is now committed in ff85f11, so it is
   believed redundant, but the operator should confirm and clear it.

### Confirmation
Nothing pushed, deployed, migrated, or irreversibly applied. No PR, database, environment, auth,
email, account, TestFlight, or App Store action. No worktree deleted, moved, reset, or pruned.

## C2 overnight run — security follow-up queue (Items 9-11)

Started: 2026-08-08 (local). Stop rule: operator turn/item limit, or when no safe runnable item
remains. No wall-clock stop time was supplied. Item cap: 3.

- Worktree: C:\Users\cdfee\projects\nb-overnight-20260807
- Branch: fix/nighttime-mobile-hardening
- Starting SHA: ff85f117a888e31776887cf00b9bb0650059c879
- Queue (operator-supplied order):
  1. g-0f4af1bc-8b52-4e00-a8ac-ef90a0b9bd6c - Item 9: Next.js request-boundary hardening (T0)
  2. g-ce503c6c-e3d9-43b1-a600-4b3bb8c1fb93 - Item 10: Durable rate-limiting architecture (T0)
  3. g-e0fb31ba-d3b2-41a7-85db-1eaf7ab684a6 - Item 11: Supabase authz verification runbook (T1)
- Preflight: overnight-guard preflight ok, tierMapSource=project, 10/10 live T0 rules, no dead rules.
  Recovery status TERMINAL/completed (no interrupted C1 run). No write lease held.
- ENOSPC precondition from C1 is CLEARED: C: now has 5.9 GB free (was 0.01 GB) and node_modules is
  present. All three specs were written to block on this; it no longer blocks.

### Protected pre-existing state (do NOT touch during C2)
The worktree is dirty with C1 Item 4 work, which the operator has explicitly ring-fenced:
`src/app/page.tsx`, `src/components/BarLightbox.tsx` (both modified) and `e2e/safe-area-top.spec.ts`
(untracked). Also `stash@{0}` ("santa-round3-preserve-inflight-edit") from a C1 reviewer.
These are NOT C2 changes. Consequence for this run: checkpoints must be NARROW commits of only the
files C2 itself changed - a broad `git add -A` checkpoint would sweep Item 4's work into a C2 commit,
which is exactly the failure recorded in memory (loop-guard checkpoint broad-commits).

### Item 9 - g-0f4af1bc-8b52-4e00-a8ac-ef90a0b9bd6c - COMPLETE
Commit: 037a527 (local only, NOT pushed). Tier T0, Santa intensity full, 3 rounds, quorum 5/5.

Changed: next.config.js; src/app/api/{waitlist,event,media-metric}/route.ts + their tests;
src/lib/{requestBoundary,vibeProfileSchema}.ts + tests; src/lib/securityHeaders.test.ts;
src/lib/mediaMetric.server.ts; src/lib/waitlistGuard.ts + test; e2e/security-headers.spec.ts.

Verification: tsc 0; vitest 160 files / 2413 tests; next build 0; secret-scan clean (705 files);
Playwright 73/73 (smoke + new header spec) on iPhone 13 + Pixel 7; production-server behavioral run
15/15 (403 origin-less, 403 cross-origin, 413 oversized, 200 real signup, 400 unknown event name,
all six headers served). Non-vacuity proven: the 6 new waitlist tests were run RED against the
unchanged route first.

Model lanes - all five succeeded each round they were run:
Claude/FABLE (preflight expected_model=fable, override absent), Codex gpt-5.6-sol (proofs
4e251d54, 4643fb29), DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi K3 deep.

Findings unique to ONE lane:
- Codex only: missing Places UI Kit CSP hosts (places.googleapis.com, *.googleusercontent.com,
  and the Google webfont hosts an earlier draft of mine had wrongly removed); the missing
  regression test pinning media-metric's native-origin behavior.
- Claude/FABLE only: the savedAt silent-data-loss trap; media-metric's inline sameOrigin
  silently 403-ing capacitor:// native beacons; the parseVibeProfile name collision.
- DeepSeek only: the allowAbsent truthiness bypass (' ' or true buying leniency).
- GLM only: the imprecise sendBeacon justification string.
- Codex AND DeepSeek independently: the escaping stream rejection.
- Kimi only: guardOrigin should be documented as a browser-originated gate so a future
  signature-authenticated webhook skips it by design rather than by workaround.

Refuted with repository evidence (recorded, not silently dropped):
- DeepSeek's ":443 port time bomb" - the URL API already normalizes default ports.
- FABLE r2's "no test asserts any security header" - its grep was case-sensitive and missed the
  lowercase header names in the 13-assertion securityHeaders.test.ts.
- GLM's savedAt conflict-resolution inconsistency - that invariant belongs to the separate
  public.vibe_profiles table and its 0033 LWW trigger, not the waitlist snapshot column.
- GLM's unbounded request.json() / server-action / stale-importer omissions - verified none remain.
Adjudicated by Kimi: GLM's "reject-absent-Origin is a funnel regression" overruled (on HTTPS an
intermediary cannot strip headers without terminating TLS); DeepSeek's HIGH on the capacitor
allowlist overruled (the same client can send a matching https Origin, so it grants nothing new).

Residual risk / follow-ups NOT done here (deliberate, recorded):
1. CSP is Report-Only with NO report sink, so no telemetry arrives on its own. Promotion to
   enforcing is an ATTENDED check. Kimi recommends adding a collector endpoint; that is a new
   mutating API route and belongs to its own change.
2. The Capacitor WebView origin is INFERRED from capacitor.config.ts, never observed on device.
   capacitor://localhost + ionic://localhost are allowlisted so a wrong inference is non-fatal,
   but an attended TestFlight check of the signup form is still owed.
3. T0 post-deploy smoke check is OUTSTANDING - this run authorized no deploy, so the verified
   state is intermediate, not final.
4. Per-route scoping of the native-shell allowlist (Kimi, hygiene only, no security gain) and a
   shared boundary-result mapper (GLM) were deferred rather than done at round 3.
5. Uneven runtime validation in direct Supabase helpers remains from the original audit -
   upsertServerVibeProfile rebuilds from destructured fields and is auth+RLS+LWW guarded, but its
   tag/neighborhood element types are not allowlist-checked. Outside Item 9's stated scope.

### Item 10 - g-ce503c6c-e3d9-43b1-a600-4b3bb8c1fb93 - COMPLETE
Commit: 5bf69c8 (local only, NOT pushed). Tier T0, intensity full, 3 rounds, quorum 5/5.

Changed: src/lib/rateLimiter.ts, rateLimiter.durable.ts, rateLimiter.test.ts (new);
src/lib/waitlistGuard.ts (+test), mediaMetric.server.ts; the four API routes; two new route-level
policy suites; supabase/migrations/0043_rate_limits.sql (WRITTEN, NOT APPLIED).

Verification: tsc 0; vitest 163 files / 2469 tests; build 0; secret-scan clean; Playwright 73/73;
production-server behavioral run 5/5 with the shared store deliberately UNREACHABLE - waitlist fails
open (200), the local backstop still binds (4 of 14 throttled, so fail-open is NOT unlimited), event
fails open at the limiter (503 at the store, not 429), one IPv6 /64 shares a bucket, a different /64
keeps its own.

Lane status: Claude/FABLE, Codex gpt-5.6-sol, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi K3 deep - all succeeded.
Codex TIMED OUT once at 540s on an oversized round-2 packet (exit 124, supervisor confirmed
process-tree termination); re-run with a narrowed packet and returned valid output with proof. A
timeout was NOT counted as approval. FABLE BLOCKED twice; both blocks closed.

Findings unique to ONE lane:
- Claude/FABLE only: two RAW NUL BYTES making rateLimiter.ts binary to ripgrep (the core module was
  invisible to every content search); compressed-IPv6 mis-bucketing reopening the 2^64 rotation
  bypass; NODE_ENV arming the refusal on Vercel PREVIEW deploys too; and a rollout note that my own
  earlier fix had silently turned into a production-outage instruction.
- Codex only: malformed dotted quads and empty zone indexes coerced into real buckets.
- DeepSeek only: IPv4-mapped notation granting DOUBLE quota (its stated mechanism was wrong; the
  defect was real and verified empirically before acting).
- GLM only: partial configuration being indistinguishable from intentional local-only, with the
  degraded flag staying false so monitoring shows green while the global cap does not exist.
- FABLE + DeepSeek + GLM converging: an unconfigured shared tier silently leaving the
  irreversible-action quota per-instance.
- Kimi only: adjudicated the L1/L2 window seam as the standard fixed-window 2x property rather than
  a composition bug, and endorsed the Postgres-over-Redis choice with named exit criteria.

Attended-only decisions STOPPED at, none made: applying 0043; provisioning any paid KV/Redis;
creating or setting RATE_LIMIT_KEY_SALT; salt rotation cadence; enabling pg_cron (avoided by design);
sign-off on the fail-open policy for event/media-metric.

### Item 11 - g-e0fb31ba-d3b2-41a7-85db-1eaf7ab684a6 - BLOCKED (REVIEW_INCOMPLETE)
WIP preserved at 652020d. Tier T1. Santa round 1 = BLOCK; quorum NOT met.

Claude/FABLE ran and blocked with 1 High + 4 Medium. Codex, GLM and DeepSeek did NOT run, so the
'both' panel never reached quorum. Under the unattended rule that is REVIEW_INCOMPLETE, never NICE.

What is sound: parser, report generator and 14 static tests are OFFLINE BY CONSTRUCTION (node:fs and
node:path only - no network, no database contacted, which was the item's central constraint), run in
the ordinary vitest gate, and every assertion is paired with a broken fixture. Their generated
numbers are independently true: 39 migrations 0000..0043, 21 tables, 21 of 21 with RLS, 41 functions,
29 SECURITY DEFINER, 0 unpinned search_path.

Why blocked - the deliverable IS the expected state, and parts of it are wrong:
1. Check 2 claims all but two tables have a policy; six more are intentionally policy-less, so an
   operator on a HEALTHY Staging would log six false mismatches.
2. public.schema_migrations is created by the migration RUNNER, not a migration, so the parser cannot
   see it; a healthy schema has 22 tables, not 21.
3. The anon-grant invariant covers 2 tables; the corpus grants to anon on three (bars, bar_photos,
   pairwise_comparisons) - FABLE's own allowlist named only two, which is itself evidence the
   expectation must be generated rather than written by hand.
4. tableGrants has no corpus-level non-vacuity guard.
5. Function tail-attribution spans to the next function, so a future 'alter function ... set
   search_path' could falsely mark an unpinned definer as pinned. Not live today.

Root cause, demonstrated on myself: my own verification regex reported all 21 tables as policy-less
- false - because policy names are quoted and contain colons ("profiles: owner can read own"). The
policy and grant expectations must be GENERATED like the counts already are.

NEXT ACTION: /santa-loop g-e0fb31ba-d3b2-41a7-85db-1eaf7ab684a6 --unattended --intensity both
after generating the policy/grant expectations and adding schema_migrations to Checks 1-3.

## C2 RUN SUMMARY

Status: QUEUE_TERMINAL - 2 complete, 1 blocked. Commits: 037a527, 619b109, 5bf69c8, 652020d.
Deployed RLS parity remains UNVERIFIED; Item 11 builds the means to check it and was not finished.

Nothing was pushed, deployed, migrated, or irreversibly applied. No PR, no database connection, no
environment/auth change, no email, account, TestFlight or App Store action. Migration 0043 was
WRITTEN and NOT APPLIED. No worktree was added, moved, removed, pruned, reset or cleaned; no stash
was created or dropped.

Protected C1 Item 4 state is intact and still uncommitted: src/app/page.tsx,
src/components/BarLightbox.tsx (modified) and e2e/safe-area-top.spec.ts (untracked), plus stash@{0}.
`loop-guard checkpoint` DID sweep all three into a commit as memory warned; that commit was undone
with a soft reset and the files restored to their exact prior state, and every later commit was
path-scoped by hand.

# OVERNIGHT RUN C3 — 2026-08-08

Started: 2026-08-08 02:40:52 America/New_York (EDT)
Stop time: 2026-08-08 08:00 America/New_York (hard)
Item cap: 1 (loop-guard --max-iters 1, outcome=proceed)
Worktree: D:\harness-worktrees\nb-20260808-expanded\item3-overflow
Branch: harness/nb-20260808-expanded/item3-overflow
Starting SHA / revert point: 689e564edd0de5744f07e920230c6b98fae0d092
Queue (operator-supplied, in order):
  1. g-b9dc294e-06fa-4b9c-a1aa-e241bae3d6fa — Item 3: Add-a-bar mobile horizontal overflow fix (stored status: planned)

Preflight: overnight-recovery IDLE; git status clean; lease null/not live;
overnight-guard preflight TIER_MAP_READY (project map, 10 T0 rules, 0 dead).
Known environment risk at start: node_modules ABSENT in this worktree; C: has 4.8 GB free
(D: has 628 GB). npm cache 770 MB. This item requires typecheck/build/Playwright.

## Item 3 — g-b9dc294e-06fa-4b9c-a1aa-e241bae3d6fa — implementation

Status after /code: ready_for_review. Branch harness/nb-20260808-expanded/item3-overflow.
Local commit: 013243f (nothing pushed).
Changed files: src/components/QuickAddBar.tsx, e2e/add-bar-overflow.spec.ts.
Tier on actual changed paths: T1, t0FileCount 0, escalated false, skippable false.

PRECONDITIONS. The stored spec's Execution step 1 asks for a new
fix/nighttime-mobile-hardening branch created from <AUTH-NICE-SHA>. That branch already
exists AND is checked out by a LIVE peer session in C:\Users\cdfee\projects\nb-overnight-20260807,
so creating/switching to it is forbidden. It was NOT created or touched. The operator's
2026-08-08 queue re-homed this item to this dedicated worktree and branch, and required all
writes to stay here, so the work was done here. The intent behind the precondition is
satisfied and was verified rather than assumed: efca486, 76d610f and b6a7957 are all
ancestors of this HEAD (git merge-base --is-ancestor), i.e. the reviewed auth base is
already contained in the base this item builds on.

ENVIRONMENT. node_modules was absent. It was restored with `npm ci --offline` — strictly
from the local 770 MB npm cache, 647 packages, ZERO network egress. Playwright browsers were
already cached locally. The C1 disk blocker is gone: D: has 628 GB free and the worktree is
on D:.

WORK. The residual HIGH from santa round 3 was real and is now closed. QuickAddBar's
variant="search" match list — the path every returning user takes — clipped an unbreakable
bar name silently inside a bare overflow-hidden <ul>. RED against the unmodified component
on iPhone 13, verbatim:
  [hidden, no affordance] mt-2 bg-surface border border-border rounded-2xl overflow-hi
  scrollWidth 1025 vs clientWidth 340
independently reproducing Claude/FABLE's earlier 1025-vs-340 measurement. The suite could
not reach that path at all because gotoRankings() clears localStorage; the new
gotoRankingsWithExistingRating() seeds one rating so rankings/page.tsx:216 mounts the search
variant. The dialog-scoped guard was generalised to take a root selector, so the same
round-3 affordance logic now covers this list. Fix: the row is a flex line with min-w-0 on
its text children and an intentional ellipsis (criteria 3 and 4), not a clip.

VERIFICATION (all bounded-run, foreground).
  add-bar-overflow.spec.ts: 13 passed on EACH of iPhone 13, Pixel 7, iPhone 17 (exit 0 each).
  npm run typecheck: exit 0. npx vitest run: 164 files / 2483 tests passed.
  npm run build: Compiled successfully. npm run secret-scan: clean, 721 tracked files.
  git diff --check: clean.
  NOTE: running all three Playwright projects CONCURRENTLY collapses under this machine's
  load (even page.reload times out). Each project must be run serially with --workers=1;
  done that way, all three are green.

CORRECTION I MADE MID-RUN, recorded because I got it wrong first. rankings-add-flow failed
during verification and a single A/B run each way appeared to blame my change, so I switched
the fix from break-words to flex+min-w-0+truncate. The failure then reappeared on a
DIFFERENT untouched element, which is not how a deterministic regression behaves. Decisive
control: I restored QuickAddBar.tsx to its exact HEAD content (git show HEAD:<path>, backing
my version up first — no stash, no checkout, no reset) and ran the spec twice; BOTH baseline
runs failed the same test the same way. rankings-add-flow is flaky AT HEAD tonight under
three concurrent peer sessions — every stall is Playwright's "visible, enabled and stable"
actionability check, never an overflow assertion. Not a regression from this item. The final
fix was kept on layout merit and the component comment that had claimed test evidence for
that choice was corrected.

NEXT ACTION: /santa-loop g-b9dc294e-06fa-4b9c-a1aa-e241bae3d6fa --unattended --intensity auto
